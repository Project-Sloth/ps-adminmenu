# Installation
1. Download the latest release.
2. Add the files to your server resources.
3. Ensure `ps-adminmenu` in your server cfg. Make sure ox_lib starts before ps-adminmenu.  
4. Set the config in `shared/config.lua` to your needs.

A community video has been made for setup instructions and showcase, you can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aez5RIi8db8&ab_channel=Kamaryn)
   
## Permissions
Make sure you've correctly configured player permissions in your server.cfg by using ACE permissions with the appropriate identifier. Otherwise, you'll be unable to access or launch the admin menu. Here's a sample configuration where the player, MonkeyWhisper, is assigned god, admin, and mod roles, you should not have all 3 permissions for a single person. For a deeper understanding of how QBCore manages permissions, refer to [this documentation.](https://docs.qbcore.org/qbcore-documentation/guides/setting-permissions)

### Player Permission
```
add_principal identifier.fivem:565139 qbcore.god # MonkeyWhisper
add_principal identifier.fivem:565139 qbcore.admin # MonkeyWhisper
add_principal identifier.fivem:565139 qbcore.mod # MonkeyWhisper
```


## Setting Up Logs
1. Set up a Discord Webhook for the channel you want the logs to be.
2. Add this to `qb-smallresource/server/logs.lua` - 
`['ps-adminmenu'] = 'discord webhook'`
3. Replace the place holder with your webhook link.
